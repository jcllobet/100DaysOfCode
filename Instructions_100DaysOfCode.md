# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Overview

These are the instructions for the #100DaysofMLCode Challenge:
- Log each day in which you code
- 1 day break is allowed, but not 2 consecutive one's
- Publish the code when possible, otherwise, log what was done.  

## Motivation

Want to better understand the (complex) engineering systems that sustain the most simple and UX friendly websites. May also sidetrack into Machine Learning and other projects. 

## Eligibility 

- Everyone is eligible, even people who've never coded before. Just push the updates!

## The 3 Rules

- Make a public pledge to code or study machine learning for minimum 1 hour every day for the next 100 days via your favorite social platform using the #100DaysofCode Hashtag.
- Make a public log of your work. Update it daily. Here is a GitHub example [template](https://github.com/george-studenko/100_Days_of_ML_Code/blob/master/README.md). You can also make a blog or vlog. 
- If you see someone make a post using the #100DaysofCode hashtag, encourage them via a 'like', 'share', or comment!
