## Day 0 : Sep 29 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have joined and attended [AI Saturdays](https://nurture.ai/ai-saturdays) in Barcelona today, I completed a couple of chapters on the Computer Vision Nanodegree I'm working on right now. I've been working on creating masks to do some image edition with CV2 (OpenCV). Learned about color spaces (RBG, HSI and HSL) and worked on a simple image classifier, creating a basic ML pipeline to load images, pre-process images and predict and image label.  

**Thoughts** : Getting to work and know people who is interested in AI, ML and DL is great to share knowledge and encourage each other, a great way to learn. Computer vision is a daunting part of AI, but with the right material, teachers and projects I think I will manage to pull it over, got time until the end of December 2018 to get it done.
