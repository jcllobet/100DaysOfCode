## Day 1 : March 2nd , 2022
 
**Today's Progress** :  
- A lecture to refresh Conditionals and Datatypes in JS. Still not used to '===' comparisons. 
- Relatively straightforward exercises. It was a great challenge to implement @quicksort. Had a grasp of recursion but not how to get rid of the trailing space. 
- Refactored the personal website with Bootstrap to make it responsive. 
- Fought with MongoDB instalation and permissions for about 2 hours. Planning to add it locally and ship it in node.js.

**Thoughts** : Sometimes I hate getting stuck with small details / bugs but when I get through the bottleneck realize that those nuances actually matter.

## Day 0 : March 1st , 2022
 
**Today's Progress** : I have joined [Strive School](https://strive.school) FullStack Course. As a Data Scientist, I have found myself lacking in the Software Engineering Department and felt like it was a good opportunity to go all in. Lecture was super fun and interactive. Homework was to create a personal website in HTML and CSS. It did not take me much to setup a basic minimalistic website inspired in [@Patrick Collison's website](https://patrickcollison.com/). Got carried away with Node.JS and Linode and went to upload it on a server. Followed a tutorial on setting it up with the right security permissions with actually sent me in a 3h detour -as I initially created everything directly in @root-. 

**Thoughts** : I really like the idea of comitting to code daily, specially if being able to do so in an environment with equally motivated people and mentors to
