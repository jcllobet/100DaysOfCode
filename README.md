## Day 2 and day 3: March 2nd, 2022
 
**Today's Progress** :  
- A lecture to refresh Loops and functions in JS and the relevant exercises
- Preparing Data Science lecture for AI Saturdays Copenhagen 
- Updated flat search scrapper to bypass cookies and dynamic HTML class names. 

**Thoughts**: I have been consuming a lot of information about Ukraine and the war. Hard to focus on coding once you realize how privileged we are to not be there right now. Trying to help out Ukrainian friends and thinking about the 2nd order ramifications of this war.

## Day 1: March 2nd, 2022
 
**Today's Progress** :  
- A lecture to refresh Conditionals and Datatypes in JS. Still not used to '===' comparisons. 
- Relatively straightforward exercises. It was a great challenge to implement @quicksort. Had a grasp of recursion but not how to get rid of the trailing space. 
- Refactored the personal website with Bootstrap to make it responsive. 
- Fought with MongoDB installation and permissions for about 2 hours. Planning to add it locally and ship it in node.js.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes I hate getting stuck with small details/bugs but when I get through the bottleneck realize that those nuances actually matter.

## Day 0: March 1st, 2022
 
**Today's Progress** : I have joined [Strive School](https://strive.school) FullStack Course. As a Data Scientist, I have found myself lacking in the Software Engineering Department and felt like it was a good opportunity to go all in. The lecture was super fun and interactive. Homework was to create a personal website in HTML and CSS. It did not take me much to set up a basic minimalistic website inspired by [@Patrick Collison's website](https://patrickcollison.com/). Got carried away with Node.JS and Linode and went to upload it on a server. Followed a tutorial on setting it up with the right security permissions with actually sent me in a 3h detour -as I initially created everything directly in @root-. 

**Thoughts**: I really like the idea of committing to code daily, especially if being able to do so in an environment with equally motivated people and mentors.
